vIn this folder I am trying a more sophisticated approach with respect of
using the dictionary. 
Here I have manually selected 200 good comments and 120 bad comments to 
DiMaio's feeds.
Then, using the nltk module we are going to analyse how many bad and
good comments are present


IN this case 100 and 100 items gave very low accuracy

The accuracy of the classifier is:
