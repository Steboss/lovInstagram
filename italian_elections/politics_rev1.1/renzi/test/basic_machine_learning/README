In this folder I am trying a more sophisticated approach with respect of
using the dictionary. 
Here I have manually selected 100 good comments and 100 bad comments to 
Renzi's feeds.
Then, using the nltk module we are going to analyse how many bad and
good comments are present

The accuracy of the classifier is:
Most Informative Features
                      PD = True              pos : neg    =      4.8 : 1.0
                   renzi = True              pos : neg    =      3.7 : 1.0
                      in = True              neg : pos    =      3.6 : 1.0
                      ha = True              neg : pos    =      3.6 : 1.0
                     gli = True              neg : pos    =      3.1 : 1.0
                     una = True              neg : pos    =      3.1 : 1.0
                     non = True              neg : pos    =      3.1 : 1.0
                     che = True              neg : pos    =      2.8 : 1.0
