classifier.py  
This is the script we will use for the analysis. It needs a dictionary
of good and bad words to descriminate between positive and negative comments
Results: 
Pos raw 155 out of 1746
Neg raw 1591 out of 1746



class2.py 
As before, it employes a dictionary, however we are trying to understand the 
entire line
Results:
Pos raw 612 out of 1746
Neg raw 1134 out of 1746

From classifier.py we can write two files, storing the positive and negative comments
From there we can move on with a more machine_learning based algorithm
to detect which are the pos and neg comments
