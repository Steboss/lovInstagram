Here I am creating a c code for computing the trnasition matrix 
of each comment words
Later, I'll apply this code on the comments and figures captions


- In cython take the input file name and open it
- go through each line, creating a list, count how many words we have
- take into account also stopwords for the moment
- once we have the total counter we can ask C to create a counter*counter matrix
- in C compute the transition probability, so pass an array with all the
lines of the comment_text
- Starting from the first line, split the words at each space, go through 
each word  and count the trnaasition probability
